## Movie App with Next.js
This is a clean, fully functional movie app using 
- Next.js 15, 
- TypeScript, 
- clerk, 
- MongoDB, and 
- Tailwind CSS. 

This covers all the basics of fullstack development with NextJS 15. No unnecessary complexity—just real-world features like server actions, route handlers, database integration and clerk for authentication that you can apply to your own projects. 

## What You’ll Learn:
- ✅ Setting up a Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
- ✅ Using server actions for backend operations
- ✅ Handling API requests with route handlers
- ✅ Add dark mode functionality
- ✅ Connecting and working with a MongoDB database
- ✅ Styling the app with Tailwind CSS for a clean UI
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Deploying the project for real-world use

You can use these concepts and code to implement in your NextJS projects


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
